# Testing Documentation

The testing documentation has been consolidated to avoid duplication.

Please see [../TESTING.md](../TESTING.md) in the root directory for complete testing instructions, including:

- Demo Test Suite (Test-Driven Development)
- Running tests with Maven
- Viewing HTML test results
- Visual comparison tools
- Integration testing

The root TESTING.md is the authoritative version with the most up-to-date information.
